#  Java algorithms that solve each of the three tasks below:

## Task One:
1. Given an array K with N integers from 1 to N+1 such that the array has exactly one integer missing, write

- Java function that returns the missing integer. e.g. given **K = [3,5,4,1]**, the function should return **2**.

## Task Two:
2. Given a string S of length N, write a Java function that transforms the string by reversing characters in groups of four, and returns the transformed string, e.g...

- when **S = 'Lorem at'** the output should be '**eroLta m**'
- when **S = ' Tempor ip'** the output should be '**meT roppi**'

## Task Three:
3. Data base

## Repository COMMITS:

1. Task one: Finding a missing integer in an array.
2. Task two: Reversing string characters in groups of four.
3. Create DB tables, and Inserting data
4. MySQL query: MySQL query that will display the number of students per course per institution.
5. Rectified bugs in both tasks 1.
