#  Java algorithms that solve each of the three tasks below:

## Task One:
1. Given an array K with N integers from 1 to N+1 such that the array has exactly one integer missing, write

- Java function that returns the missing integer. e.g. given K = [3,5,4,1], the function should return 2.

## Task Two:
2. Given a string S of length N, write a Java function that transforms the string by reversing characters in groups of four, and returns the transformed string, e.g...

- when S = 'Lorem at' the output should be 'eroLta m'
- when S = ' Tempor ip' the output should be 'meT roppi'

## Task Three:
3. Data base

### COMMITS:

1. Task one: Finding a missing integer in an array.
2. Task two: Reversing string characters in groups of four.
3. Create DB tables
4. MySQL query: MySQL query that will display the number of students per course per institution.
